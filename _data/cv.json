    "summary": "Hi! I am Aayush, a Graduate Student pursuing a Master of Science - Robotic Systems Development (MRSD) in the Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon University.Previously I worked in the Qualcomm compilers team during 2022 - 2024 to accelerate on-device AI. I graduated with a Bachelors degree in Computer Science and Engineering from Visvesvaraya National Institute of Technology in 2022. While at VNIT, I interned at Google developing internal finance dashboards and a feature in the payments app GPay. In my free time, I like to read, run and lift.",
